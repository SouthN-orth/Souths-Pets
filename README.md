South's Flying Bison Mod

Initial Idea:
A large flying 'beast of burden' which will be able to carry several chests worth of items for easy transport between bases or when moving house or just to generally fly.


ToDo:

1. Get past initialisation stage
2. Let the bison fly
3. Create and refine models for saddlebags/saddle
4. Give them inventories for saddles and chested storage.
