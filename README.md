South's Flying Bison Mod

Initial Idea:
A large flying 'beast of burden' which will be able to carry several chests worth of items for easy transport between bases or when moving house or just to generally fly; based on the show Avatar:The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra


ToDo:

1. Get Bison to spawn
2. Let the bison fly and allow player control while riding.
3. Create and refine models for saddlebags/saddle
4. Give them inventories for saddles and chested storage.
